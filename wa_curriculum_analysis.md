# Western Australian Curriculum Analysis - Year 5 Mathematics

## Overview

The Year 5 Mathematics curriculum in Western Australia is organized into three main strands:
1. Number and Algebra
2. Measurement and Geometry
3. Statistics and Probability

Each strand contains specific content descriptions that outline what students should learn. The curriculum emphasizes four proficiency strands that are integral to mathematics learning:

- **Understanding**: Making connections between representations of numbers, using fractions to represent probabilities, comparing and ordering fractions and decimals, and identifying line and rotational symmetry
- **Fluency**: Choosing appropriate units of measurement for calculation of perimeter and area, using estimation to check reasonableness of answers, and using instruments to measure angles
- **Problem-solving**: Formulating and solving authentic problems using whole numbers and measurements and creating financial plans
- **Reasoning**: Investigating strategies to perform calculations efficiently, continuing patterns involving fractions and decimals, interpreting results of chance experiments, and interpreting data sets

## Detailed Content by Strand

### Number and Algebra

#### NUMBER AND PLACE VALUE
- Identify and describe factors and multiples of whole numbers and use them to solve problems (ACMNA098)
- Use estimation and rounding to check the reasonableness of answers to calculations (ACMNA099)
- Solve problems involving multiplication of large numbers by one- or two-digit numbers using efficient mental, written strategies and appropriate digital technologies (ACMNA100)
- Solve problems involving division by a one-digit number, including those that result in a remainder (ACMNA101)
- Use efficient mental and written strategies and apply appropriate digital technologies to solve problems (ACMNA291)
- Understand and work with positive and negative integers in various mathematical contexts (ACMNA102)

#### FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS
- Compare and order common unit fractions and locate and represent them on a number line (ACMNA102)
- Investigate strategies to solve problems involving addition and subtraction of fractions with the same denominator (ACMNA103)
- Recognize that the place value system can be extended beyond hundredths
- Compare, order, and represent decimals

#### MONEY AND FINANCIAL MATHEMATICS
- Create simple financial plans

#### PATTERNS AND ALGEBRA
- Describe, continue, and create patterns with fractions, decimals, and whole numbers resulting from addition and subtraction
- Find unknown quantities in number sentences involving multiplication and division and identify equivalent number sentences involving multiplication and division

### Measurement and Geometry

#### USING UNITS OF MEASUREMENT
- Choose appropriate units of measurement for length, area, volume, capacity, and mass (ACMMG108)
- Calculate perimeter and area of rectangles using familiar metric units (ACMMG109)
- Compare 12- and 24-hour time systems and convert between them (ACMMG110)

#### SHAPE
- Connect three-dimensional objects with their nets and other two-dimensional representations (ACMMG111)

#### LOCATION AND TRANSFORMATION
- Use a grid reference system to describe locations. Describe routes using landmarks and directional language (ACMMG113)
- Describe translations, reflections, and rotations of two-dimensional shapes. Identify line and rotational symmetries (ACMMG114)
- Apply the enlargement transformation to familiar two-dimensional shapes and explore the properties of the resulting image compared with the original (ACMMG115)

#### GEOMETRIC REASONING
- Estimate, measure, and compare angles using degrees. Construct angles using a protractor (ACMMG112)

### Statistics and Probability

#### CHANCE
- List outcomes of chance experiments involving equally likely outcomes and represent probabilities of those outcomes using fractions (ACMSP116)
- Recognize that probabilities range from 0 to 1 (ACMSP117)

#### DATA REPRESENTATION AND INTERPRETATION
- Pose questions and collect categorical or numerical data by observation or survey (ACMSP118)
- Construct displays, including column graphs, dot plots, and tables, appropriate for data type, with and without the use of digital technologies (ACMSP119)
- Describe and interpret different data sets in context (ACMSP120)

## Curriculum Alignment with Requirements Document

The requirements document specifies that the tutorial program must cover all the topics outlined in the WA Curriculum for Year 5 mathematics. The program should be organized into modules corresponding to each topic and include interactive lessons, practice exercises, and assessments.

Key topics from the requirements document that align with the curriculum:
- Positive and negative integers
- Square and triangular numbers
- Prime and composite numbers
- Four operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Multistep problem solving
- Mental strategies and fluency
- Elapsed time and timetables
- Measuring using formal units
- Connecting 3D objects to nets
- Statistical investigations and data collection

The tutorial program will need to cover all these topics while ensuring alignment with the official curriculum standards.
